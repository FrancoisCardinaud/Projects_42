What to do:

- check correspondance between cub3D.h commented file names and actual file names
- understand Raycasting algorithm
- understand wall collision
- perhaps copy other raycasting algo from other project
- keep mixing up file structure and function structures
- make sure function names are coherent
- check leaks
- check norminette
