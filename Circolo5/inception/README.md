- Copy .env from Desktop to inception/srcs/
- Copy ssl/ from Desktop to inception/srcs/requirements/nginx/conf/
- (Add IP address of VM to /etc/hosts on host machine if needed)

Explanations:

Explanation of Docker and docker-compose:
You should be able to explain how Docker isolates applications by running them in containers and how docker-compose simplifies the process of managing multiple containers through a single YAML configuration file.

Docker image with/without docker-compose: The difference lies in how Docker handles dependencies between containers. docker-compose allows you to orchestrate multiple containers, define networking, volumes, etc., in one file, which is harder when using Docker alone.

Benefits of Docker vs. VMs: Docker containers are more lightweight compared to VMs as they share the same OS kernel and donâ€™t require a full guest OS for each instance, leading to faster start times and reduced resource usage.

Docker networking:
Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other, the host, and external networks. Docker creates virtual networks, like "bridge" (the default), where containers on the same network can interact using internal IPs. Containers can also expose ports to communicate with external networks. Docker networks isolate containers for security and can be managed with commands like docker network ls, docker network inspect, and docker network create. In docker-compose, services connect through defined networks, allowing controlled communication between them.
